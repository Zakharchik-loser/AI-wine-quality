So....Nodofy is reading this.....But if you do,here's some info about this project:

1.I had litearly no idea how it's gonna for the view you can see right now,The main idea was about rag and ofc model prediction
2.If you do wanna test it out,you must make a .pkl file where you'll save your model state
3.This project was made for a local testing,so you can't really login through google unless you'll configure it's way by yourself
4.The design is kinda ass but I do prefer backend logic over the cute styles
5.If you do enjoy,it's gonna be really cool,but I still don't think you'll read this
